# Step 1 := Frist make a array that will take input of the int as an array.
# Step 2 :- Look the the minimum int (element) in the array.(buy)
# step 3 :- Loop for the maximum int (element) in the array.(sell)
# step 4 :- index 0 means day 1

# Initialize a variable to track the minimum price seen so far
# Initialize a variable to track the maximum profit

# Loop through each price in the prices array
    # If the current price is less than the minimum price so far, update the minimum price
    # Else, calculate the profit by subtracting min price from current price
    # If this profit is greater than max profit so far, update max profit

# Return the max profit

Two pointers question
Given a sorted list of integers, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once
and return the new length.
Do not use extra space for another list â€” 
you must do this by modifying the original list in-place with O(1) extra memory.
