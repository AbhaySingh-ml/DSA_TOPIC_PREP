# üß† DSA & Coding Practice Roadmap

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** coding repository!  
This repo is designed to track my learning journey in DSA, problem-solving skills, and coding patterns through structured topic-wise **LeetCode** practice.  
It includes my **DSA roadmap**, **coding solutions**, and **basic problems for practice**.

## üìå Objective

- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Improve problem-solving ability using Python
- Prepare for coding interviews and assessments
- Document solutions in a structured, topic-wise format
